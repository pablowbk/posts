> Now when we look at new things added to HMTL, new features, new browser APIs, what we tend to ask, of course, is: _how well does it work?_.
(...) That’s an excellent question to ask (...). But I don’t think it’s the most important question. I think it’s just as important to ask: **how well does it fail**? _[Jeremy Keith](https://adactio.com/articles/12839), on Evaluating Technology_


I just found out that my adBlocker also has an option for disabling all JS on a site:

And that made me think about what master [Keith](https://adactio.com/) said in one of his [talks](https://adactio.com/articles/12839). So I went ahead and checked out some popular sites to see how _well_ these would fail.

Some of the results might seem _obvious_, some not so much. I think it is a great exercise, to see these sites without JS enabled, because you get to see how great teams dealt with **_failing well_**. In some cases, a small design choice makes the page hold up, in others, a completely different site is served. I encourage you to try it out!

Let's see some examples:

YouTube

Twitter

Dev

Google

So let's play a **game**! Dive into the web, and look for interesting sites and see how they approach a JS-less world. I'd love it if you would post your findings as well!
