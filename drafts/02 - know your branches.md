Today I started working on a remote collab project and needed some way of seeing the active branches, but my GIT knowledge is rather limited to this day. I thought I'd try


```
$ git help branch
```

but failed to make any sense out of it.

And so, DuckDuckGoing I went...

> duckduckgo.com/?q=git+list+all+active+branches

From the results, I came across several git commands I have 
never used before. 

Let's start with the basic stuff:
### **git branch**


---

### **git branch -r**
This now looks obvious, since I do git add -a almost every time.

---

### **git branch -a**
This now looks obvious, since I do git add -a almost every time.

---

### **git show-branch**

This is the description for the aboove command

### command 3

This is the description for the aboove command



And this is just the tip of the iceberg. You can find a whole lot more info over at [GIT's Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc), and maybe write a post about it!
