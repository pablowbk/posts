Today I started working on a remote collab project (link below), and was trying to get a grasp on what had already been done. I needed some way of seeing the active branches, but my GIT knowledge was limited to just:

```
[local_repo](currentBranch)$ git branch
* currentBranch
  master
```

which only showed me my current branch and master. I then tried

```
git help branch
```

but failed to make any sense out of it.

And so, DuckDuckGoing I went...

> duckduckgo.com/?q=git+list+all+active+branches

From the results, I came across several git commands I have never used before. Here's what I learned:

- ### git show-branch
  - This is the description for the aboove command.

### command 2
